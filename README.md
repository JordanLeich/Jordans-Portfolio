Examples of previous projects I've created

# [Project 1: BlackJack 21 Game: Description](https://github.com/JordanLeich/Python-Blackjack-21-Game)
- This is a game where you play against the dealer and try to get the higher values of cards without exceeding over the number 21. If your cards ever equal a total of 21, you automatically get blackjack (win) unless both you and the dealer get 21 then you push (tie). The user also has a cash balance that is wagered based on winning or losing, the user must keep their cash balance positive and not negative to keep playing.

# [Project 2: Junk File Cleaner for Windows: Description](https://github.com/JordanLeich/Junk-File-Cleaner)
- This is used as a python script that I use for my computer. This script is set to automatically run everyday at 1:30pm, once running the script will open a pre-installed cleaning program that is on every windows PC and then open two other junk folders inside of windows to clean up.

# [Project 3: Graphic Creator: Description](https://github.com/JordanLeich/Graphic-Creator)

- This is a turtle program that allows the users to be given many options to create their own custom or randomly generated graphic! The user gets options such as choosing a graphic color, background color, graphic size and much more. The user will also be able to create even more multiple graphics by automatically restarting the program instead of ending and reopening the program over and over again.
