If your cards ever equal a total of 21, you automatically get blackjack (win) unless both you and the dealer get 21 then you push (tie). The user also has a cash balance that is wagered based on winning or losing, the user must keep their cash balance positive and not negative to keep playing.\r\n\r\n![BlackJack](images/blackjack.jpg \"BlackJack 21 Game\")\r\n\r\n# [Project 2: Junk File Cleaner for Windows: Description](https://github.com/JordanLeich/Junk-File-Cleaner)\r\n- This is used as a python script that I use for my computer. This script is set to automatically run everyday at 1:30pm, once running the script will open a pre-installed cleaning program that is on every windows PC and then open two other junk folders inside of windows to clean up.\r\n\r\n![Junk](images/junk.jpg \"Junk Folders\")\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
